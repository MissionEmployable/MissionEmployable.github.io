<!-- Oh, hello! Are you inspecting my website?
 The whole inspiration of this "website" was to be bare bones;
 a single page, no nested directories, no fluff - just a simple static webpage that gets the point across! 
 I hope you'll call me at +1 (480) 734-6450 so we can get started today building something incredible together. -->

                    <h4>AI DEVELOPER to IT DIRECTOR to PRESIDENT | September 2023 to August 2025</h4>
                    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> React Native, Python, MS SQL, 3rd party AI tools, AWS (primarily API Gateway, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, S3, SES)</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Text-to-text Dental LLM/AI:</strong> Built the largest dental text dataset, with 2.2 million training samples harvested from 25+ years of Dentaltown data and magazine articles, PubMed studies going back to 1840, multiple textbooks, podcast/CE transcripts, ADA/BLS data, and more</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Labeled and legally harvested training data using SQL, web scraping, SFTP, transcription services, manual methods, and more</li>
                        <li>Preprocessed training data to optimize LLM behavior, and built an internal tool for managing and cleaning the training samples further</li>
                        <li>Fine-tuned (trained) LLM with HuggingFace/PyTorch/CUDA, but after implementing, decided to use Together.ai for cost/time reasons</li>
                        <li>Built API to manage chat history, leverage a custom targeted advertising system, provide RAG data, personalize the UX, and more</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>IT Infrastructure Rebuild:</strong> After building the LLM, I expressed concerns about the IT infrastructure as it related to declining engagement, network traffic, and internal processes, and was asked to restructure the company and rebuild both frontend and backend systems, plus infra.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Modern, cross-platform React Native frontend; scalable, serverless Python backend; cost-effective, state-of-the-art CICD & infrastructure</li>
                        <li>Built custom solutions: search engine, digital ads system, instant group messager, secure token auth. system, robust notifications (web sockets, APN/CFM, email), hundreds of backwards compatible API endpoints and stored procedures, and more</li>
                        <li>The most challenging aspect was no documentation & backwards compatibility with the legacy system, as it is being redesigned in phases</li>
                        <li>Numerous department functions were automated using "AI function calling", Selenium, Python, and other tools to reallocate labor</li>

                    <h4>FULL STACK DEVELOPER | May 2023 to September 2023</h4>
                    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Python, Flask, HTML/CSS/JS, MySQL, MongoDB, REST APIs, AWS (primarily SQS, SES, S3)</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Cap'n Chat (capnchat.ai):</strong> The first ever online AI group chat platform, where more than one user and more than one AI model could chat through a single interface, playing text-adventure role playing games, integrating three text-to-text and three text-to-image LLMs</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The frontend and backend were built with Python and Flask, along with MySQL, MongoDB, and a plethora of AWS services</li>
                        <li>Integrated GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, & PaLM 2 Bison for chats, DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, & Midjourney for avatars & image messages</li>
                        <li>300 users signed up without any real marketing aside from a few posts on Twitter, but it became clear we needed custom LLMs to facilitate the type of roleplay content that people were interested in, which lead me to pursue a position at Farran Media where I fine-tuned an LLM</li>

                    <p><strong>Data Migration:</strong> .NET project to migrate partial data from three MongoDB sources, thousands of CSV/Excel files, a legacy MySQL database, as well as an LIS API into a new MySQL database in order to unify the company's data and simplify generating reports and investigating patient records</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The previous database was too rigid, not allowing for new clients or test types to be created, and so we created a more abstract and flexible schema, with numerous mapping tables and an audit trail using triggers, and an internal tool for searching records</li>
                        <li>Migrating over 50 million records was rushed to meet government regulatory mandates, and so the migration was broken across 12 machines (virtual and physical), each implementing 8 threads and serving up to 25K records per hour</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>.NET Backend Automation:</strong> The company's backend used three dependent Python projects, which were never designed but added to overtime as new features were needed, and were written by employees before me who were learning to code as they went, and so it was quite challenging to work with, leading me to write two .NET solutions to replace the existing systems, designed to be flexible and user-friendly for developers</p>
